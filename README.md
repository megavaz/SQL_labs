# SQL_labs

You can download oracle db 11g [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mP5EjLDgq7SN4sVbyJgUxstegjFOW9qP?usp=sharing "don't afraid to click it, it's my google drive"), it's needed for pl/sql.
When you'll be installing it, it will ask you to set a password. Later you'll need this password to connect to database. It's not said explicitly but the user name will be __system__. 

I personally use DataGrip to do this labs.
